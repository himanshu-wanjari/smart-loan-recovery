# Smart Loan Recovery System using Machine Learning

Smart Loan Recovery is a machine learning-based project designed to help financial institutions optimize loan collection efforts. By analyzing historical loan data, borrower profiles, and repayment behavior, the system predicts loan default probabilities and suggests strategies to maximize repayments and reduce recovery costs.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts probability of loan default using classification models
- Uses borrower demographics, loan history, and behavioral data
- Supports data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- Visualizes insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Deployable as a decision-support tool for recovery teams

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (for optional dashboard)
- Git for version control

## 📊 Dataset

- Historical loan repayment dataset (anonymized)
- Includes features like income, credit score, loan tenure, employment type, etc.
